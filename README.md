# Day 3: Code Along - Jquery

Fork this Repo, Clone it to your local computer and open up the files! It contains an .html file and .css file with some code in it. It also contains an empty .js file. This is where you will be adding your code during the lesson demos. Your instructor will be using these same files during the examples. Open the posters.html file in the browser and refresh it whenever you save some new code to script.js

### JQuery:

This poster.html file is linked to the JS library JQuery which we will be using to manipulate the .html and .css code in the browser.
